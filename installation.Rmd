# Installation of R and RStudio

## What is R and RStudio?

R, or RStudio is a statistical software programming package that allows the user to carry out different types of statistical analysis. It can also be used as a GIS software to perform various kinds of spatial analysis. In the same vein, you can use it for data managing and geo-processing (i.e., importing different types of spatial formats for manipulation beforehand for spatial analysis). There are two versions:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/week1/image1_R-versiontypes.png', error = FALSE) 
```

The famous icon on the left is the version for [**R**](https://www.r-project.org), and the one on the right is the version for [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com). Both software packages are the same. The only difference is that RStudio is attractive, intuitive, and more importantly, it is user-friendly than Base R. So, we will be using this version (i.e., RStudio). 

Let us talk about downloading RStudio.
